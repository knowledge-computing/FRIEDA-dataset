Within which 'Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEPs) for the Worst-Case 4-Day Rainfall' range does this point fall?\nassistant\nTo identify the 'Highest Water Levels' point labeled 'Manchester, TX' for Hurricane Harvey, we refer to the provided map and legend.\n\nThe map shows various water levels in different regions, with Manchester, TX marked as having a water level of 10.35 feet. The legend for 'Highest Water Levels' indicates the following ranges:\n\n- Purple: 8 feet or more\n- Red: 5 - 8 feet\n- Orange: 3 - 5 feet\n- Yellow: 1 - 3 feet\n- Green: 0 - 1 feet\n\nManchester, TX has a water level of 10.35 feet, which falls under the purple category (8 feet or more).\n\nNext, we need to determine the 'Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEPs) for the Worst-Case 4-Day Rainfall' range for this point. The legend for AEPs shows different ranges:\n\n- Blue: < 1\/1000\n- Green: 1\/500 - 1\/1000\n- Light Blue: 1\/100 - 1\/500\n- Medium Blue: 1\/50 - 1\/100\n- Dark Blue: 1\/10 - 1\/50\n- Black: 1\/50 - 1\/10\n- Red: 1\/10 - 1\/5\n- Orange: 1\/5 - 1\/2\n- Yellow: 1\/2 - 1\n- Green: 1 - 5\n- Light Green: 5 - 10\n- Dark Green: 10 - 25\n- Brown: 25 - 50\n- Black: 50 - 100\n- Gray: > 100\n\nSince Manchester, TX is associated with a water level of 10.35 feet, we need to find the corresponding AEP range. The water level of 10.35 feet is not directly listed, but we can infer it from the context of the map and the given information. The map shows that areas with water levels around 10 feet are likely in the range of 10 - 25 AEPs.\n\nTherefore, the 'Highest Water Levels' point labeled 'Manchester, TX' falls within the AEP range of 10 - 25.\n\nFinal"
