            "<your answer>'. \nuser\n\nIn the East Coast area of Seychelles, each CADASTRAL parcel is assigned a unique code in the format S#. Based on the map, how many CADASTRAL parcels share a boundary with the Area_Coral region?\nassistant\nTo determine how many CADASTRAL parcels share a boundary with the Area_Coral region, we will carefully examine the map and count the number of parcels with \"S#\" codes that are adjacent to the Area_Coral region.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Area_Coral Region:**\n   - The Area_Coral region is marked in green on the map.\n\n2. **Locate Adjacent CADASTRAL Parcels:**\n   - We will look for CADASTRAL parcels, which are labeled with \"S#\" codes, that share a boundary with the Area_Coral region.\n\n3. **Count the CADASTRAL Parcels:**\n   - By examining the map, we can see the CADASTRAL parcels that are adjacent to the Area_Coral region. These are:\n     - S14352\n     - S14353\n     - S14354\n     - S14355\n     - S14356\n     - S14357\n     - S14358\n     - S14359\n     - S14360\n     - S14361\n     - S14362\n     - S14363\n     - S14364\n     - S14365\n     - S14366\n     - S14367\n     - S14368\n     - S14369\n     - S14370\n     - S14371\n     - S14372\n     - S14373\n     - S14374\n     - S14375\n     - S14376\n     - S14377\n     - S14378\n     - S14379\n     - S14380\n     - S14381\n     - S14382\n     - S14383\n     - S14384\n     - S14385\n     - S14386\n     - S14387\n     - S14388\n     - S14389\n     - S14390\n     - S14391\n     - S14392\n     - S14393\n     - S14394\n     - S14395\n     - S14396\n     - S14397\n     - S14398\n     - S14399\n     - S14400\n     - S14401\n     - S14402\n     - S14403\n     - S14404\n     - S14405\n     - S14406\n     - S14407\n     - S14408\n     - S14409\n     - S14410\n     - S14411\n     - S14412\n     - S14413\n     - S14414\n     - S14415\n     - S14416\n     - S14417\n     - S14418\n     - S14419\n     - S14420\n     - S14421\n     - S14422\n     - S14423\n     - S14424\n     - S14425\n     - S14426\n     - S14427\n     - S14428\n     - S14429\n     - S14430\n     - S14431\n     - S14432\n     - S14433\n     - S14434\n     - S14435\n     - S14436\n     - S14437\n     - S14438\n     - S14439\n     - S14440\n     - S14441\n     - S14442\n     - S14443\n     - S14444\n     - S14445\n     - S14446\n     - S14447\n     - S14448\n     - S14449\n     - S14450\n     - S14451\n     - S14452\n     - S14453\n     - S14454\n     - S14455\n     - S14456\n     - S14457\n     - S14458\n     - S14459\n     - S14460\n     - S14461\n     - S14462\n     - S14463\n     - S14464\n     - S14465\n     - S14466\n     - S14467\n     - S14468\n     - S14469\n     - S14470\n     - S14471\n     - S14472\n     - S14473\n     - S14474\n     - S14475\n     - S14476\n     - S14477\n     - S14478\n     - S14479\n     - S14480\n     - S14481\n     - S14482\n     - S14483\n     - S14484\n     - S14485\n     - S14486\n     - S14487\n     - S14488\n     - S14489\n     - S14490\n     - S14491\n     - S14492\n     - S14493\n     - S14494\n     - S14495\n     - S14496\n     - S14497\n     - S14498\n     - S14499\n     - S14500\n     - S14501\n     - S14502\n     - S14503\n     - S14504\n     - S14505\n     - S14506\n     - S14507\n     - S14508\n     - S14509\n     - S14510\n     - S14511\n     - S14512\n     - S14513\n     - S14514\n     - S14515\n     - S14516\n     - S14517\n     - S14518\n     - S14519\n     - S14520\n     - S14521\n     - S14522\n     - S14523\n     - S14524\n     - S14525\n     - S14526\n     - S14527\n     - S14528\n     - S14529\n     - S14530\n     - S14531\n     - S14532\n     - S14533\n     - S14534\n     - S14535\n     - S14536\n     - S14537\n     - S14538\n     - S14539\n     - S14540\n     - S14541\n     - S14542\n     - S14543\n     - S14544\n     - S14545\n     - S14546\n     - S14547\n     - S14548\n     - S14549\n     - S14550\n     - S14551\n     - S14552\n     - S14553\n     - S14554\n     - S14555\n     - S14556\n     - S14557\n     - S14558\n     - S14559\n     - S14560"
