However, the legend shows different zones and mineral occurrences associated with specific ranges. The 'Gold Zone' is indicated in the legend, suggesting that the 'Grid F' might be part of a zone with gold content. However, the question specifically asks about a 'Mineral Occurrence' farthest from the mine trend.\n\nThe correct answer would be the 'Mineral Occurrence' in the '4.68 - 7.51' range, which is associated with a specific zone and appears to be located farthest from the mine trend marked in the legend. Without more specific data from the map, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact name of the mineral occurrence. However, based on the legend and the context, the closest match for a 'Mineral Occurrence' in the given zones would be the one in the '4.68 - 7.51' range, which might be part of a gold zone.\n\nSo, the answer is: '4.68 - 7.51'."

            "<your answer>'. \nuser\n\nIn the Osprey Grid region of Red Willow project, which Ground Geophysical Survey area is not crossed by the 'SWML Survey - 2007' lines?\nassistant\nTo determine which Ground Geophysical Survey area in the Osprey Grid region of Red Willow project is not crossed by the 'SWML Survey - 2007' lines, I will examine the map and identify the specific areas marked by different symbols:\n\n- The 'SWML Survey - 2007' lines are represented by the blue line.\n- The other survey methods (Gradient Resistivity, 3D Resistivity, Gravity Survey, and TEM Survey) are represented by different colored lines.\n\nUpon analyzing the map, I can see that the area labeled as 'SWML Survey - 2007' does not cross over the lines for other survey methods. Therefore, the area not crossed by the 'SWML Survey - 2007' lines is likely the 'Induced Polarization - Pole Dipole - 2007' or another specific survey method not listed in the context.\n\nThis indicates that the 'SWML Survey - 2007' lines likely outline a boundary or specific region within the Osprey Grid, and other methods are represented by different lines and symbols. The 'SWML Survey - 2007' lines may delineate a boundary or specific area not marked by other survey methods. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n'Induced Polarization - Pole Dipole - 2007'"

This is indicated by the legend where the \"URBAN MOTORWAY\" is listed as an option for the \"KEY PEDESTRIAN LINKS\" and the \"PAIRING SPACES ALONG STREETS\" category. The urban motorway is a major road system that runs through the area, providing multiple lanes for vehicles and facilitating traffic flow, while the pausing spaces along streets are designated for pedestrians to use as nodes or canopies for more open outdoor space. These intersections likely serve as points of transition where pedestrians can pause briefly to use the public space, such as parks or recreational areas, given their role in facilitating movement and providing designated areas for people to use."
