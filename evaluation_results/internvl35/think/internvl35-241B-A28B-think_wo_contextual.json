There is no map or geographical information visible in the image to answer the question about mineral tenures or private land parcels.\n\nHowever, based on typical map analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Other Mineral Tenure**: \n   - Look for adjacent blocks or areas labeled as mineral tenures next to the \"Green Mountain Property Mineral Tenures 1,075,773.\"\n   \n2. **Count the Private Land Parcels**:\n   - Determine how many private land parcels intersect with the identified mineral tenure.\n\nSince the image does not provide this information, I cannot give a specific answer. Normally, you would use the map's legend and labels to identify these features and count the intersections. \n\nIf you have a map image that includes these details, please provide it, and I can help analyze it."
