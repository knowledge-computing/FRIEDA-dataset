Let's assume the distance is approximately 2 kilometers? Wait, no, maybe more. Wait, the map's scale is 1:50,000, but the graphic scale is in kilometers. Let me check the positions. The Eden Project is around the center of the blue area, and Eden 2 Claim is the dashed black box above. The distance between them\u2014let's see, the graphic scale: each unit is 1 km.
