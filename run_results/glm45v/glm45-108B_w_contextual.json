The Estuarine and Marine Wetland is in the green area on the Wetlands map. Now, check which flood hazard zone that green area falls into.

In Figure 10, the area around La Vida Mission is labeled with \u201cSan Juan Co.\u201d, indicating San Juan County. Thus, Lake Valley School is in <|begin_of_box|>San Juan County<|end_of_box|>."
